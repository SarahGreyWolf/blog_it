NOW! That's what I call software

# Location
London, England, United Kingdom

# Employment
Looking for work as a software developer/engineer utilising Rust, C#, Typescript, C++ and C that is backend focused.

# What am I doing
Currently flip-flopping between an experiment on JIT compiling with Rust, writing opcodes to memory and then executing that memory region like a function, and experimenting with RabbitMQ in Rust utilising the rabbitmq-c library and FFI to connect to a server, I've always had it in my brain that I need to learn and understand AMQP and working with brokers at some point.

# What am I playing
I'm currently playing a mixture of Stellaris, No Mans Sky and Destiny 2 (since the DLC just came out).
